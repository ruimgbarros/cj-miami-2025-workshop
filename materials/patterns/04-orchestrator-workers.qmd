## What Is This Pattern?

Orchestrator-Workers is like an editor coordinating multiple specialized reporters. A central "orchestrator" agent delegates tasks to "worker" agents with specific expertise, monitors their progress, and integrates their findings into a coherent final product.

This pattern is ideal for complex investigations where different aspects require different expertise. The orchestrator plans the work, assigns tasks, and synthesizes results - much like an editor manages a team on a major investigation.

It's like combining routing and parallelization with an added layer of coordination and synthesis.

## How It Works

### Conceptual Overview

A central orchestrator agent breaks down complex tasks, delegates to specialized worker agents, coordinates their activities, and synthesizes results into a unified output.

# Use Cases

Orchestrator-Workers shines in complex scenarios requiring very different models. Example:

- You found on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-classification&sort=downloads) a model specialized in Political Bias Detection, another in Misinformation Detection, and another in Hate Speech Detection.
- You also want to extract summaries from the texts.
- You create an orchestrator agent that:
  - Analyzes the input text and decides which specialized worker agents to deploy based on content
  - Delegates tasks to the appropriate worker agents
  - Collects and synthesizes their outputs into a comprehensive report
- Each worker agent uses its specialized model to analyze the text for its specific focus area.
