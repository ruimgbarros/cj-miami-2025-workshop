## Welcome to the Workshop

This workshop introduces six proven AI agent architectures that solve real newsroom challenges. You'll learn to build practical "AI recipes" for journalism tasks—from document analysis to fact-checking workflows.

**No advanced programming required**—materials are designed for participants with varying technical backgrounds.

## Workshop Overview

**Duration**: 1.5 hours (90 minutes)
**Format**: Interactive notebooks with hands-on examples
**Location**: University of Miami, Newman Alumni Center

### What You'll Learn

1. When to use AI agents vs. simple prompting
2. Six proven agent architectures for journalism
3. How to build ethical AI workflows with human oversight
4. Integration strategies for newsroom tools

## Six Agent Patterns

### 1. Augmented LLM: Source Verification
Verify credibility of sources and cross-reference claims using enhanced LLMs with access to fact-checking databases.

### 2. Prompt Chaining: Document Analysis
Multi-step analysis of complex documents—extract → summarize → fact-check → highlight key findings.

### 3. Routing: Story Classification
Automatically categorize and route incoming news/tips to appropriate beats and workflows.

### 4. Parallelization (Sectioning): Multi-Source Research
Research same topic across different databases/sources simultaneously.

### 5. Parallelization (Voting): Claim Verification
Verify disputed facts by checking against multiple methodologies and comparing results.

### 6. Orchestrator-Workers: Complex Investigation
Coordinate multi-faceted investigations with different data types and sources.

## Getting Started

### Choose Your Level

This workshop accommodates different technical backgrounds:

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### 🎯 Conceptual Track
**For non-coders**: Focus on understanding patterns, use cases, and ethical implications.
- Read explanations and use cases
- View architecture diagrams
- See demonstrations
- Discuss applications to your newsroom

#### 🛠️ Guided Track
**For some coding experience**: Follow along with pre-built examples.
- Understand the code structure
- Run provided examples
- Modify simple parameters
- See results in action

#### 🚀 Adaptive Track
**For developers**: Customize and extend the examples.
- Study implementation details
- Adapt patterns to your needs
- Build your own variations
- Integrate with your tools

:::

## Prerequisites

### What to Bring
- Laptop with internet connection
- Curiosity about AI in journalism
- (Optional) API key for Claude if you want to run examples

### No Required Installation
All examples can be viewed and understood without running code. For those who want to run examples, instructions are provided in each notebook.

## Ethical Framework

Throughout this workshop, we emphasize:

::: {.callout-important}
## Critical Considerations
- **Human Oversight**: AI as augmentation, not replacement
- **Transparency**: Clear disclosure of automated processes
- **Accuracy**: Verification requirements and hallucination risks
- **Privacy**: Data handling and source protection
- **Bias**: Recognition and mitigation strategies
:::
